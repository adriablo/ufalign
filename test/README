NOTES

* SPEED: logging has significant impact on speed; should set level to 'warn'

* SPEED: output stream mutex (gSAMOutMutex) does NOT have significant impact on speed

* SPEED: multiple threads do NOT saturate the CPU core(s) - is there any locking/contention inside SeqAn?

* SPEED: single-thread is actually much slower than multi-thread; multi-threading is an obvious improvement
