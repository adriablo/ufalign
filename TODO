[1] Multithreading
* benchmark vs mrFAST
* benchmark: speedup with # of threads?
* 


[2] CMake
* cleanup
* debug / release builds


[3] Per module logging
* selective enable/disable logging


[4] Speed up by not resolving alignments fully
* calculate only edit distance and save positions to file
* resolve alignments on demand - after search
* create a separate program to resolve alignments


[5] Test: compare to mrFAST
* positions may be slightly off in some cases, where mrFAST has problems with edge clipping
* need python script to handle the clipping differences above


[6] Still some duplicates in alignments produced (output)
